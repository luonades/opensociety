  Societies are associations of people who agree on something about how the 
  society should be. They can create new rules and specific data views.
  Our first societies are planned to be some of the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Product Life-time Society</li>
    <li>Antroposophist Society</li>
    <li>Mixed Waste Tax Society</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  If you'd like to be one of our pilot societies, please contact us in the email
  address given at the bottom of the page. Just describe your ideas about the 
  society briefly, and we'll get started!
