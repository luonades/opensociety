  <h1>About Open Society Platform</h1>
  <h2>Open Society Platform</h2>
  <p>
    Internet revolution has started. It can be seen in BitCoin, Aikapankki, 
    DemocracyOS, D-CENT, AirBNB, Uber, open databases, etc. OpenSociety is a 
    generic framework for creating these kinds of new social systems. Also 
    existing social systems can be encoded and thus more easily controlled in 
    OpenSociety. With the help of OpenSociety, these systems can be more easily 
    set up and connected to each other. It also offers an information production 
    system for them.

  <p>
    The OpenSociety system may be applied to the society in general, or within 
    just some part of it such as economics, politics, juridical system, or 
    within just some insititution(s) like a hospital, school, a university, a 
    company, a network of business partners, a political party, a group of 
    like-minded friends, etc. The systemic idea of OpenSociety can be
    implemented in any media, eg. paper and pen, web application.
