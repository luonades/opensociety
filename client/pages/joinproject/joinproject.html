<template name="joinprojectPilots"><section id="joinprojectPilots" class="tablecell">
<h2>Pilots</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Waste Tax Society in 15.4.-30.6.2014 in Finland
  </li>
  <li>Mini demos on Facebook and events</li>
  <li>
    Coming up: Antroposophical society that is based on the
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_threefolding" target="_blank">
    social threefolding</a> philosophy on society: the money, the law and the culture
    are separated from each other. For example, money can not buy or steer
    art or science in this society.
  </li>
  <li>
    We're also planning an Ethical shop for daily accessories that has 
    only ethically produced daily accessories on sale, and has a standard 
    information card at the side of each product so consumers can make
    truly informed decisions. The physical store would be backed up by a web shop
    later on.
  </li>
  <li>
    Want to start a new pilot? 
    We're looking to start at least two more pilots during 2015.
    Just send us a short email and we'll get started.

<template name="joinprojectSoftware"><section id="joinprojectSoftware" class="tablecell">
<h2>Software</h2>
<ul>
<li>
  We have two programmers coding the Society Kit
</li>
<li>
  The code is fully open source:
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/luonades/societykit/">
  GitHub</a>
</li>
<li>
  We're developing the website on the
  <a href="http://meteor.com/" target="_blank">Meteor</a> platform, which is
  a leading-edge web app framework that uses JavaScript
  on both the client and server
</li>
<li>
  The user interface is laid out with HTML5, Handlebars, CSS3 and Stylus
</li>
<li>
  The data is fetched from open databases of public institutions, 
  research organizations and companies via API's and file types like REST, XML, XLS, CSV
  and also by directly scraping HTML from websites
</li>
<li>
  The data is stored in a 
  <a href="http://mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> database
</li>
<li>
  The raw data is cleaned, analyzed and quantified
  in <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a>
  statistics software, which is connected to the web app by
  <a href="https://gitorious.org/r-node" target="_blank">R-Node</a>
</li>
<li>
  Finally, the data is visualized on the website by the
  <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a> and
  <a href="http://threejs.org/" target="_blank">ThreeJS</a> visualization libraries
</li>
<li>
  These tools are be beautiful, powerful and widely used in industry so
  learning them is surely both rewarding and extremely valuable
</li>
<li>
  We're happy to help you get started
</li>
</ul>
