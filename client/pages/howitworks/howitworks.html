<h2>How on Earth...?</h2>
<p>
  Once upon a time, there was a <b>man who felt completely powerless</b> in front 
  of the problems of the world. And he ended up doing nothing. <!--

</p>
<p>With Society Kit, he could...</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Change society towards your ethical values.</b>
  On the Society Kit website, people with similar ethical values can find each 
  other and change the rules of the society among themselves
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Make informed decisions.</b>
  Society Kit allows you to make more informed decisions in a super market
  or in elections, by collecting data about companies, politicians, products
  and other things from open databases, news websites and users
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Society Kit is in an early phase, but already you can start using it:
you can create and join societies for issues you care for and 
collect data about products. Please, wish for next features on our
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/societykit/" target="_blank">Facebook
group</a>!

<h1>Once upon a time...</h1>
<p>...there was a citizen, a politician, an entrepreneur,
a journalist and a citizen activist. They formed up a group to provide for
each other. However, after evolving their interactions for a long time,
their interactions and deals with one another had become so complex
that they didn't even understand themselves how it all worked,
and how something could be changed as everything was so intertwined and
seemed anchored via so many strings.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  The citizen felt completely powerless in front 
  of the problems of the world. And he ended up doing nothing.
  </li>
  <li>
  There was also a politician, who was trying to decide which policy
  would be the best to choose, but she didn't have a clue. All she had,
  was the baseline of her political party, which was just based on beliefs
  and too big assumptions - to be critical about it.
  <!--who felt the parliament he was a member of,
  didn't listen to it's citizens and who hid some too conspicious issues
  behind the doors - and he just didn't have enough time to arrange a campaign
  about every issue she found problematic in the governance.-->
  He 
  </li>
  <li>
  Then there was the chief executive of a company, who had got his company 
  attacked by the citizen and the annoying journalist. They seemed to turn over
  every stone, even those things were not really that big or worthy digging out.
  And on the other side, he had all the investors and the whole success of the
  company at his hands, and he's head was on the table. If he'd do everything
  perfectly, all customers would go to the competitor's shop, because his prices
  would have to go up on double price.
  </li>
  <li>
  The news reporter, instead, saw her daily meal shrinking
  smaller and smaller, because all the things she wrote about were already
  written ten times better in one of the global media companies - he didn't
  just have the resources to compete with them in informing the people about
  the world.
  </li>
  <li>
  And finally, there was the citizen activist. He tried and tried and pushed
  and pushed, in order to change the society to the direction he wanted and
  to get all people to agree on his side. However, he slowly started getting
  frustrated, angry, disappointed and pessimistic. It never changed, or
  it changed so slowly and so little.
  </li>
  
  <p>
  Please be patient reading on to the end... until you find out what
  happened to all these poor people in uncomfortable, troublesome situations.

<h2>Societies</h2>
<p>
The ability to create societies changes the way societies evolve:
best policies can be found by trial and error, and thus the never-ending
debate in parliaments can have evidence of which approaches work and
which don't.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Societies are <b>associations</b> of people who agree on some ethical principles,
    on laws that should exist, or on needs for some data that should be available.
    They may, in fact, focus on any <b>social system</b>.
    <button id="howitworksPopupSocietiesButton" 
      class="button popupLink">Read more</button>
  </li>
  <li>
    Societies have features such as: discussion forum, principles, laws, 
    institutions, society-specific data visualizations, information and file sharing,
    marketplace, decision-making procedures
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Laws</b> of a society are decided by its members and they are legally
    binding on the basis of the contract law
    <button id="howitworksPopupLawsButton" 
      class="button popupLink">Read more</button>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Conditional commitments</b> allow you to get guaranteed results for your
    efforts and sacrifices for a better world.
    <button id="howitworksPopupConditionalCommitmentsButton" 
      class="button popupLink">Read more</button>
  </li>
  <li>
    Society Kit provides also a platform for managing your organization
    or company.

    How are they different from normal Facebook groups?

  </li>
  
</ul>
<p>
Societies can start small (even with just one person) and they can grow
bigger and bigger if people think it works well. The false assumptions
can be corrected along the way. As a society grows even bigger, it
can include companies and organizations within it. Best societies and 
laws can be safely included to an official state's policy, as it has been
developed for a long time and has been proven to work well.
It is a marketplace of societal thoughts.

<template name="howitworksPopupSocieties">{{#popup}}<div class="howitworksPopupSocieties">
<h1>Societies</h1>
<p>
Societies may focus on any social system_
economic, political, juridical, moral, communication, science, public services, 
culture, ecology, and so on. You are able to apply the system to whatever context
you find suitable, with a similar systemic structure.
</p>
</div>{{/popup}}</template>

<template name="howitworksPopupLaws">{{#popup}}<div class="howitworksPopupLaws">
<h1>Laws</h1>
<p>
Laws of societies can be decided by the members of the society and they
are legally binding on the basis of the contract law.
</p>
<p>
For example, you could make a basic income pilot globally among people who
support it.
</p>
<p>
There are some laws that always need to exist in a society:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Joining procedure is defined by the society - just like
  countries define their tolls, border controls and terms of getting citizenship
  </li>
  <li>
  Exiting procedure. For example, the society may require you to pay your
  debts within its monetary system, do your punishments or make everyone
  who joins to remain a member for a certain period of time in order to
  prevent abuse of the society.
  </li>
  <li>
  Decision-making process means whether for example the laws can be changed
  by the initiator of the society (dictature) or by the process of direct 
  democracy or representational democracy.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
All these laws are up to the society members to design according to what
makes their society function the best way.
</p>
</div>{{/popup}}</template>

<template name="howitworksPopupConditionalCommitments">{{#popup}}
  <div class="howitworksPopupConditionalCommitments">
<h1>Conditional commitments</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    Conditional commitments especially are useful for guaranteeing the outcome of
    a single rule before committing to it and thus making an ethical but
    tough decision: for example, you may commit to pay 1 % of your income
    to remove the starvation in poor countries, but ONLY if a sufficient number 
    of people are committed so that enough money is gathered for completely
    removing the starvation. This also increases the benefits of your commitment:
    by committing you get the other conditional committers to do the same
    hard decision.
  </li>
</ul>
</div>{{/popup}}</template>



<template name="howitworksPopupOrganizations">{{#popup}}
  <div class="howitworksPopupOrganizations">
<h1>For organizations</h1>
<p>
Society Kit provides a platform for running organizations like 
companies, citizen organizations and public institutions, so
that their operations can be directly connected to the data available
via Society Kit and societies which they'd like to cooperate with
</p>
</div>{{/popup}}</template>

  
    
<template name="howitworksPopupFacebook">{{#popup}}<div class="howitworksPopupFacebook">
<h1>How are societies different from Facebook groups?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>The society can set laws that bind them legally.</li>
  <li>Societies can have own money, laws and other systems</li>
  <li>People find the societies based on their ethical values</li>
  <li>Organized data collection from world about relevant things to the society</li>
  <li>Customized views on the data. Eg. about product sustainability if that's
  the main focus of the society.</li>
  <li>
  The societies have access to databases and can show this data on their
  page and collect some specific data together in a database (compared
  to a list of comments, discussions, photos and files in the Facebook
  group's feed.
  </li>
  <li>A society can choose from multiple types of governance methods such
  as dictature, direct democracy and representational democracy
  (a Facebook group has one or multiple admininstrators who decide what
  the group description says and whose comments are moderated out)
  </li>
  <li>The society can have multiple types of members: 
  visitors, trial-time memebers, full members, etc.</li>
  
  <li>Big societies can set up institutions within them to work
  on specific areas of the society: eg. local economy institution,
  culture institution, communications institution, etc.</li>
  <li>
  Society Kit is open source code, so anyone can go and find out whether they
  like how it works. On Facebook, the user can not know what exactly Facebook
  does with all the data about him, what it contains and where it ends up.
  </li>
  <li>
  On Society Kit the user has full power to view, edit or remove all data
  that he has ever submitted to the website.
  </li>
  <li>Society Kit is a non-profit project with highly ethical, altruistic goals,
  in comparison to Facebook whose main interest is to make money to its
  investors
  </li>
  <li>Also, there are no advertisments on Society Kit</li>
  
</ul>
<p>
The main difference is that people are vastly more committed to societies 
on Society Kit and also that they provide specific functionalities for 
running a society.

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>
On Society Kit, you can explore data about companies, people, organizations, 
governments,  politicians, their opinions, speeches, public votes, their deeds, 
their consequenses and impacts, products, ownerships, sales events, manufacturing, 
natural resources, and so on. All data about the society. The data is collected 
from open data bases and individual contributors like individual citizens or 
journalists. Also you can insert and edit the data below. 
</p>
<ul>

  child labor, and your jogging show manufacturer is estimated to have
  the child labor in proportion to its revenue.

<h2>Platforms</h2>
<p>
Society Kit provides the following platforms:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    This <b>website</b> serves as the main hub for Society Kit. Its open source
    code is available to all, but due to privacy and other issues, the access
    to data is controlled by the website administrators (the Society Kit group).
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <b>Physical world connections</b> include cashier machines, material flow sensors, etc.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <b>A platform for web development</b> is provided so that anyone can 
    create their own, new web apps that are directly
    connected to the Society Kit data and societies, but have different
    functionalities
  </li>
  <li><b>Application programming interface (API):</b> Society Kit will 
  provide an interface for connecting other software
  to it, such as your business management solution or data analysis software</li>
  <li>
    <b>Games:</b> Society Kit societies and data can also be utilized for
    fantasy games. For example, you could build connections and social rules
    between World of Warcraft players.
  </li>
  <li>
    The idea of Society Kit can even be turned into a physical <b>paper and
    pen solution</b>: Laws can be made via paper contracts and data collected
    on paper sheet forms. (just like most of societal activity still happens
    at the moment)
  </li>
</ul>
</section></template>



<template name="howitworksViability"><section id="howitworksViability"
  style="background-image: url('images/howitworks/kuala-lumpur-edited2.jpg');" >
<h2>Viability</h2>
<p>
Society Kit is enabled by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Newest web technologies and algorithms:</b> 
    Meteor.js web framework,
    open databases,
    agent-based modelling of entities of society in Mongo database,
    source reliability network algorithm similar to those used in
    Facebook feed and Amazon recommender system,
    data analysis functionality of R,
    pattern recognition and qualitative data analysis algorithms,
    and data visualization tools of D3 and ThreeJS
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>A business model</b> that includes open source development of the code,
    developing ordered functionality for organizations,
    integrating Society Kit to an organization's systems,
    technical support,
    and prices for pro functionality such as pro data mining or pro organization
    management features
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>The contract law:</b>
    People are allowed to make contracts. If many people do the same contract,
    it looks like a new "law" among those people. The limitations come from:
    (1) the new laws need to abide by the official laws, and (2)
    the punishments for not following a new law is limited to
    the punishments that are legal to be agreed in contracts (eg. jail time
    is not possible)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>A great user experience:</b> We aim for a superb usability and user experience
    in our design, so that people would feel at ease using the system
    on their laptops as well as on mobile phones and could concentrate just
    on taking use of the power of the system
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Benefits</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Citizens</b> find people with similar thoughts and are thus empowered in 
    solving the world's problems.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Companies</b> are connected to their consumers, big data about their
    market environment, and get automated reporting (such as CSR report)
    which they need/want to do for their stakeholders.

    <b>Journalists</b> get a new business model via the microtasking logic of
    producing information. They are also able to work together to build a
    holistic picture of the world.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Non-governmental organizations</b> can build their ideal society
    and their supporters around the world can join it. So they can start

    <p>
  Internet revolution has started. It can be seen in BitCoin, Aikapankki, 
  DemocracyOS, D-CENT, AirBNB, Uber, open databases, etc. Society Kit is a 
  generic framework for creating these kinds of new social systems. Also 
  existing social systems can be encoded and thus more easily controlled in 
  Society Kit. With the help of Society Kit, these systems can be more easily 
  set up and connected to each other. It also offers an information production 
  system for them.
</p>
<p>
  The Society Kit system may be applied to the society in general, or within 
  just some part of it such as economics, politics, juridical system, or 
  within just some insititution(s) like a hospital, school, a university, a 
  company, a network of business partners, a political party, a group of 
  like-minded friends, etc. The systemic idea of OpenSociety can be
  implemented in any media, eg. paper and pen, web application.

<template name="howitworksPopupDiagram">
<div name="howitworksPopupDiagram">
{{#popup}}
      
  <h2>Main elements</h2>

  <img id="pageHowitworksDiagram" src="images/societykit-diagram-medium.png" 
  alt="[Image: Diagram of Open Society Platform]"/>

  <p>
  In the above image, the main components of the OpenSociety are described. On the top-left corner,
  the society modelling structure is a formal, agent-based modelling structure to formally encode any
  societal system. It can encode agents, relations, actions, impacts, objects. Specific to each society, it
  can encode their rules and procedures. It is based on the earlier work in the field of computational
  social science. The modelling structure enables the creation of new societal systems in the software
  and provides the structure for gathering the information in a consistent data format.
  </p>
  <p>
  In the middle of the image, the blue area depicts all the societal systems and rules that have been
  created by people. For example, the systems may be economic systems, political systems, juridical
  systems and public services. Users can create rules (eg. taxes, restrictions) and procedures (eg.
  marketplace, decision-making) from the generic templates in the system (eg. Online shop, online
  democratic parliament, business management system (ERP), e-government platform) or create a
  new system from the beginning. As an example, the waste tax society that has been experimented in
  real-life already, is encoded: when a participant produces a bag of mixed waste, he or she pays a 2-
  euro tax to the society. The society has decided to share the money equally back to the participants
  so that the low waste-producers get money back in the end and the high waste-producers end uu
  paying, but an alternative could be for example to offer free bio waste bags for the society's
  participants. Some of the societies may be as simple as include only one rule, eg. not buying any
  meat, while others may implement whole ideologies.
  </p>
  <p>
  One user can belong to many societies as long as their rules do not conflict. Also, the societies may
  impose restrictions and requirements for interactions with other societies, eg. tolls for CO2 
  </p>
  <p>
  emissions or requirement for fulfilling some quality level or standard. The societies may also have
  an interface with the official societies. While the basic idea is to let societies decide everything on
  their own, some restrictions need to be imposed for common interest like for the use of environment
  and land and creation of dangerous items like some weapons. The theoretical work will find
  solutions for these issues.
  </p>
  <p>
  The green area at the bottom of the image describes the information production system. Information
  is collected from the use of the system itself, from open databases and application programming
  interfaces (API's) as well as (in the future) by automatic data mining eg. on news company and
  research organization websites. All sources are managed and their reliability is estimated with a
  trust network algorithm. All data is turned into compatible formatting by defining tranformation
  functions to each source. It is then organized according to the society modelling structure so that it
  can be automatically processed and used by the societies. Qualitative information is either tagged or
  initially processed to quantify its information to the extent that is possible. Intelligent algorithms are
  used to estimate missing data from other data and to allow quantitative encoding of data on any
  abstraction level between “Some Chinese companies pollute a lot” and “The Apple store in Helsinki
  sold an IPhone 4 to Peter Peterson on 30.5.2014”. The web service also offers visualizations of the
  data in various formats and delivers it via many channels to the individual users to explore as well
  as to the societies to automatically use as a basis for its societies functioning (eg. making companies
  pay for their mixed waste).
  </p>
  <p>
  The collection, integration, quantification and processing of the information may be done both
  automatically and manually. Where manual work is required, it is paid for by the OpenSociety
  system with the small fractions that the system collects from its societies as a maintenance payment.
  The information production is paid for per its use and usefulness for the societies as well as
  reliability.
  </p>
  <p>
  On the bottom-right of the image, it is described that the idea of OpenSociety can be implemented
  in many platforms: physical or digital, real-life or game context. While the proposed project focuses
  on implementing one, general use web service, the idea could also be implemented as traditional
  face-to-face meetings and contracts on paper. More radical ideas may be better to be explored on a
  fictional game like a board game, new computer game, or within an existing role playing game like
  SecondLife or World of Warcraft. For example, some SecondLife user may start a communist mini
  society within the game if other users agree with it, too.
  </p>
  <p>
  On the left panel of the image, the users of the OpenSociety website are listed along with their
  major motivations to use the system. The users can create new societies, join and live by existing
  ones, commit to join to some rules if some amount of other users do (eg. “I will pay my share for
  the food of all starving people in the world, if 20% of other Europeans do it too and if I don't have
  to pay more than 200 € per year” or “I agree to pay for my CO2 emissions if 50% of my friends
  do”). The users can also submit data and get paid for it as well as search for the data. More detailed
  data searches may require payments from the users, but at least the information that is received for
  free (eg. from open databases) is delivered to the users for free.
  </p>
  <p>
  On top of the image, the process of the evolving of societies is depicted. One person can start a
  society that, for example, automatically can re-adjust the prices of products by taking into account
  important issues for her, eg. raise the price of high CO2 emission products and lower the price of
  low emission products. If the idea gets support, more people can get involved and cooperation with
  other parties like manufacturers of products can be started. The best ideas live and gain influence,
  they may own their factories and also be adopted to official state's systems as the policy has been
  well tested and developed and has lots of support from people.
