# Society Kit #

Society Kit is a website, where people with similar ethical values find each other and can change the rules of the society how they wish among each other. In addition, Society Kit gathers up information about companies, politicians and other entities from various data sources so that people can make informed decisions for example in supermarket or in elections.

Society Kit provides a platform for

* A whole mini society with own economic, political and legal systems
* Companies and institutions to manage their work, data and interactions with
* Researchers, journalists and citizens to share data and find big data
